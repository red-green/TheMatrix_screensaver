## I made this one day when I was bored 

There are 3 versions:

* TheMatrix2 - original, and in my opinion, the best
* TheMatrix3 - different, binary tides animation. runs slower on most computers
* TheMatrix4 - experimenting with transparent text

I included compiled version of TheMatrix2, but they are of an older version.

Feel free to check out all the commented out sections, some pieces are pretty fun.
